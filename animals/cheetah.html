        <h1>What is a cheetah ?</h1>
        <p>
          There are five subspecies of this big cat. It is slim and has
          muscular, long legs — in relation to its body size when compared to
          other cats — a small, rounded head that is set on a long neck, a
          flexible spine, a deep chest, special pads on its feet for traction,
          and a long tail for balance. It is also the only cat that cannot
          retract its claws, an adaptation to help maintain traction like a
          soccer player’s cleats. It also bears distinctive black “tear tracks”
          running from the inside corner of each eye to the mouth that may serve
          as an anti-glare mechanism for daytime hunting.

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Run like the wind. Long and lanky, cheetahs are the sprinters of the
          cat world. Their bodies are uniquely designed to run very fast for
          fairly short distances, allowing them to catch prey that other big
          cats can’t get. A cheetah’s ability to run starts with its flexible
          spine, which allows the front legs to stretch far forward on each
          stride. Its claws are hard and sharp like cleats, giving the cat great
          traction when running. A cheetah can retract its claws a bit, but the
          fleshy sheaths that protect the claws of most cats are absent in the
          cheetah. Most of the claws are exposed all the time, so they don't
          stay sharp like those of other cats.
        </p>
        <p>
          A small, cone-shaped piece of bare skin on the back of each front leg
          serves as a brake. The cat’s long tail is used as a rudder during
          high-speed chases, and its enlarged nostrils, lungs, and heart are
          adaptations that help a cheetah exert itself. While running, a cheetah
          covers 20 to 22 feet (6 to 6.7 meters) in one stride,a cheetah can run
          at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour (112 kilometers per hour). A
          cheetah is off the ground more than half of its running time!
        </p>
        <h1>HABITAT AND DIET</h1>
        <p>
          Home on the range. The cheetah survives in parts of Africa and a small
          population lives in Iran. They prefer grasslands and open plains.
          Here, they are well camouflaged and have room to run down their prey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast food. Once they’ve recovered from chasing down a meal, cheetahs
          must eat quickly, as leopards, lions, baboons, jackals, vultures, or
          hyenas can drive them away. Cheetahs aren’t strong enough to hide or
          guard their catch, so they have only one chance to eat their meal.
          They must kill more often, expending more energy than other big cats.
          They eat the meat (not usually the skin or bones) of antelope (usually
          Thompson’s gazelles), ground-dwelling birds, rabbits, porcupines, and
          ostriches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike other African predators, cheetahs don’t usually scavenge for
          food. They tend to hunt in the morning and again at dusk. They can
          hunt during the middle of the day if they have to, but during the heat
          of the day they prefer to rest.
        </p>
        <h1>FAMILY LIFE</h1>
        <p>
          Cheetahs were much more vocal (and possessed a larger vocabulary) than
          originally thought. A chirp call, which sounds a little like a small
          dog’s bark, is uttered often by both males and females and has a
          variety of meanings, ranging from “good morning” to “I’m not happy
          with you,” and even “What just happened was kind of scary!” Mothers
          use the same sound to call their cubs. They also purr, growl, snarl,
          hiss, cough, moan, and bleat, but cheetahs cannot roar like lions or
          tigers do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Female cheetahs usually give birth to three to five cubs, but some
          females have had up to eight cubs in one litter. Cubs are born with
          all their spots, so they appear much darker than the adults. They also
          have a stripe of long, silver fur called a mantle that runs down their
          back. This extra fur may help to protect the cub from weather or
          camouflage it in the tall grass.
        </p>
        <p>
          At about six months of age, the mother teaches her cubs how to hunt
          and avoid predators. Cubs live with their mothers for about 18 months
          but often become prey to lions, leopards, and hyenas. Scientists found
          that lions and hyenas kill up to 70 percent of cheetah cubs. To
          protect her cubs, a mother moves them frequently. Littermates stay
          together for about six to eight more months, sharing a territory. Then
          the females head off to live on their own, while the males stay
          together in small groups until they are mature.
