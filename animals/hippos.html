        <h1>What are Hippopotamus ?</h1>
        <p>
          There are two species of hippos — the large/common hippo and the
          smaller relative, the pygmy hippo. Hippos are the third-largest living
          land mammal, after elephants and white rhinos. Despite their large and
          bulky appearance, they have adaptations to their semi-aquatic
          environments allowing them to move swiftly on both water and land.
          Their feet have four-webbed toes that splay out to distribute weight
          evenly and therefore adequately support them on land, and their short
          legs provide powerful propulsion through the water. The pygmy hippos
          digits are more spread out and have less webbing and, proportionally,
          their legs are longer relative to its body size. They both have skin
          tones of purple-gray or slate color, with brownish-pink coloring
          around their eyes and ears. They have very thick skin that is
          virtually hairless except for the thick bristle-like hair on their
          heads and tails. The outer layers of skin are quite thin, making them
          prone to wounds from fighting. Their flat, paddle-like tail is used to
          spread excrement, which marks territory borders and indicates status
          of an individual. Their powerful jaws are capable of opening up to 150
          degrees revealing their enormous incisors.

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          The name “hippopotamus” comes from a Greek word meaning “water horse”
          or “river horse.” But hippos are not related to horses at all—in fact,
          their closest living relatives may be pigs or whales and dolphins!
          There are two species of hippopotamus: the river, or common, hippo and
          the much smaller pygmy hippo. Hippos have unique skin that needs to be
          kept wet for a good part of the day. Staying out of the water for too
          long can lead to dehydration, so hippos try to remain in water during
          the day. They don’t have true sweat glands; instead, hippos secrete a
          thick, red substance from their pores known as "blood sweat," as it
          looks like they are sweating blood. But not to worry! The blood sweat
          creates a layer of mucous that protects hippo skin from sunburn and
          keeps it moist. It is thought that this mucous may also prevent
          infections; even large wounds don't seem to get infected despite the
          filthy water hippos sometimes live in in their native habitat.
        </p>
        <h1>HABITAT AND DIET</h1>
        <p>
          Hippos are definitely adapted for life in the water and are found
          living in slow-moving rivers and lakes in Africa. With their eyes,
          ears, and nostrils on the top of the head, hippos can hear, see, and
          breathe while most of their body is underwater. Hippos also have a set
          of built-in goggles: a clear membrane covers their eyes for protection
          while still allowing them to see when underwater. Their nostrils
          close, and they can hold their breath for five minutes or longer when
          submerged. Hippos can even sleep underwater, using a reflex that
          allows them to bob up, take a breath, and sink back down without
          waking up.
        </p>
        <p>
          While hippos like to feed on patches of short grasses (called “hippo
          lawns”) close to water, they must sometimes travel several miles
          (kilometers) to find food, making long trips on land to new lakes or
          rivers. Their ears help them hear the sounds of falling fruit, and
          their keen sense of smell helps them sniff out the tasty treats.
          Hippos are mostly inactive unless eating, and this helps them conserve
          energy.
        </p>
        <h1>FAMILY LIFE</h1>
        <p>
          The hippopotamus is social, living in groups of 10 to 30 individuals.
          They have even been seen in much larger groups of up to 200
          individuals! The herd has several adult females and several adult
          males, but there is one dominant male. He has the right to mate with
          all adult females in his herd, although he sometimes allows
          subordinate males in and around his territory to mate. The dominant
          male reminds other hippos of his territory by flinging his dung as far
          as possible with his fan-shaped tail!
