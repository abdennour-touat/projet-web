        <p>
          It is the second-largest living big cat after the tiger. 
          Males are unique among the cat species for their thick mane of brown or black hair encircling their 
          head and neck. The mane darkens with age, and the thicker and darker a mane is the healthier the cat. 
          Both males and females roar — a sound heard as far as 8 kilometers away.

        <h1>Ecology and behaviour</h1>
        <p>
          Lions are at the top of the food chain. The Swahili word for lion, 
          simba, also means "king," "strong," and "aggressive."
          Prime habitat for lions is open woodlands, thick grassland, and brush
          habitat, where there is enough cover for hunting and denning. These areas
          of grassland habitat also provide food for the herbivores that lions prey upon.
          Lions differ from the other members of the large cat genus, Panthera—tigers, 
          leopards, and jaguars. Adult male lions are much larger than females and usually 
          have an impressive mane of hair around the neck. The color, size, and abundance 
          of the mane all vary among individuals and with age. The mane’s function is to make 
          the male look more impressive to females and more intimidating to rival males. 
          The lion’s thick mane also protects his neck against raking claws during fights with other 
          males over territory disputes or breeding rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lions usually hunt at night, particularly at dusk and dawn, with lionesses doing most of the work.
          A lion chasing down prey can run the length of a football field in six seconds. Their eyes have a 
          horizontal streak of nerve cells, which improves their vision following prey across a plain. 
          Lions have been spotted taking down prey as large as buffalo and giraffes! They may even drag this 
          heavy prey into thickets of brush to keep other wildlife from getting to it.
          Lions hunt antelope and other ungulates, baby elephants or rhinos, rodents, reptiles, insects, and 
          even crocodiles. They also scavenge or steal prey from leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, or African hunting
          dogs (also called painted dogs), even eating food that has spoiled. Lions digest their food quickly,
          which allows them to return soon for a second helping after gorging themselves the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
        A lioness gives birth to her cubs in a secluded location away from the pride. At birth, each cub’s coat 
        is yellowish brown and marked with distinct dark, rosette-shaped spots or, sometimes, stripes. Cubs remain 
        hidden for four to six weeks as they gain strength, learn to walk, and play with one another and their mother.
        When they return to the pride, they can nurse from any adult lioness in the pride, not just their own mother. 
        In fact, the females in a pride often give birth around the same time, which makes for lots of playmates! 
        Cubs born in a pride are twice as likely to survive as those born to a lioness that is on her own. However, 
        if a new adult male takes over the pride, he may kill cubs under one year old so that he can father new ones. 
        Under favorable conditions, a lioness can produce cubs roughly every other year.
