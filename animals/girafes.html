        <h1>What are giraffes ?</h1>
        <p>
          They are the world’s tallest mammals. They are uniquely adapted to reach vegetation inaccessible to
           other herbivores. Unusually elastic blood vessels and uniquely adapted valves help offset the sudden 
           buildup of blood (to prevent fainting) when giraffes’ heads are raised, lowered, or swung quickly. 
           Their "horns" are actually knobs covered with skin and hair above the eyes that protect the head from
            injury. Their necks contain the same amount of vertebrae as we do (seven) except their bones are extremely
             elongated making their neck a long length of 2.4 meters.

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Giraffes are the tallest land animals. A giraffe could look into a second-story window without
           even having to stand on its tiptoes! A giraffe's 6-foot (1.8-meter) neck weighs about 600 pounds 
           (272 kilograms). The legs of a giraffe are also 6 feet (1.8 meters) long. The back legs look shorter
            than the front legs, but they are about the same length. A giraffe's heart is 2 feet (0.6 meters) 
            long and weighs about 25 pounds (11 kilograms), and its lungs can hold 12 gallons (55 liters) of air! 
            Its closest relative is the okapi.
            Giraffes have a small hump on their back and have a spotted pattern similar to that of a leopard.
             For a long time people called the giraffe a “camel-leopard,” because they believed that it was a 
             combination of a camel and a leopard. That's where the giraffe's name camelopardalis comes from!
        </p>
        <h1>HABITAT AND DIET</h1>
        <p>
          Blending right in: In a zoo, giraffes stand out. But think of giraffes' presence in their African habitat,
           where their coat patterns actually serve as camouflage, blending with shadows and leaves. Giraffes are well
            adapted for living on the open, tree-dotted African plains. While other African herbivores compete for grass
             and small plants to eat, giraffes have the high branches with tender, young leaves all to themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          It takes a lot of leaves to fuel such large creatures. Giraffes may eat up to 75 pounds (34 kilograms) of food per day.
           They spend most of their day eating, because they get just a few leaves in each bite. Their favorite leaves are from
            acacia trees. These trees have long thorns that keep most wildlife from eating them. But those thorns don't stop 
            the giraffes!
            They simply use their 18-inch (46-centimeter) tongue and prehensile lips to reach around the thorns.
             It is thought that the dark color of their tongue protects them from getting sunburned while reaching for leaves.
              Giraffes also have thick, sticky saliva that coats any thorns they might swallow.
        </p>
        <h1>FAMILY LIFE</h1>
        <p>
          When a giraffe baby, called a calf, is born, it comes into the world front feet first, followed by the head, 
          neck, and shoulders. Its entry is like a slow-motion swan dive! Because the umbilical cord is only about 3 feet 
          (1 meter) long, it breaks midway through the birth, allowing the newborn to drop to the ground. The fall and the 
          landing don't hurt the calf, but they do cause it to take a big breath. The calf can stand up and walk after about 
          an hour, and within a week, it starts to sample vegetation. Sometimes the mother leaves the calf alone for most of 
          the day. The youngster sits quietly until she returns. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When a calf gets older, the mother leaves her youngster together with other calves in a "nursery." One of the moms 
        stays to babysit while the others go out to eat and socialize. In the nursery, the calves develop physical and social 
        skills through play. Under the watchful eye of the designated babysitter, the youngsters explore their surroundings 
        throughout the day. The young giraffes can eat leaves at the age of four months, but continue to nurse until they are 
        six to nine months old.
