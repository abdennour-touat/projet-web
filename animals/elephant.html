        <h1>What are African elephants ?</h1>
        <p>
          It is the second-largest living big cat after the tiger. Males are unique among
           the cat species for their thick mane of brown or black hair encircling their 
           head and neck. The mane darkens with age, and the thicker and darker a mane is 
           the healthier the cat. Both males and females roar — a sound heard as far as 8 
           kilometers away.

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          They’re enormous and intelligent, strong and sociable. Humans have been impressed by elephants for
           centuries, simply because they are so big—a male African elephant can weigh up to 7.5 tons (6.8 metric tons)!
            They also amaze us with their long and flexible noses, large and flapping ears, and loose, wrinkly skin. 
            There are many stories about elephants—you’ve probably heard of Horton, Babar, and Dumbo.
          </p>
            <p>
            African elephants  (both species) have large ears that are shaped like the continent of Africa,
             both males and females have visible tusks, their skin is very wrinkly, their back is swayed, and the end of their
              trunk works as if they have two fingers there to help them pick things up. African elephants are the largest 
              mammals on land.
        </p>
        <h1>HABITAT AND DIET</h1>
        <p>
          African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) are found in eastern, central and southern Africa, living in 
          lowland and montane forests, flood plains, and all types of woodland and savanna. The smaller African forest 
          elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) inhabit the Congo basin and western Africa in moist, semi-deciduous rainforests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elephants eat all types of vegetation, from grass and fruit to leaves and bark—about 165 to 330 pounds
           (75 to 150 kilograms) each day, which is about 4 to 6 percent of their body weight. They spend an average 
           of 16 hours per day eating! African elephants are grazer-browsers and eat grasses, including sedges, 
           flowering plants, leaves, shrubs, and small- to medium-size trees. African forest elephants are browser-frugivores 
           and eat leaves, fruits, seeds, branches, and bark.
        </p>
        <h1>FAMILY LIFE</h1>
        <p>
          Most elephants live in close social groups called herds, usually made up of related females and their offspring.
           The leader of the herd is known as the matriarch; she is usually the oldest and most experienced female in the
            group. The matriarch remembers where and how to find food and water, how to avoid predators, and the best places 
            for shelter. She also keeps the younger elephants in line and teaches them how to behave in elephant society. 
            In some cases the group may include one of the matriarch’s sisters and her offspring. When groups get too big, 
            “bond groups” split off but maintain a loose association.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adult males don't usually live in a herd. Once male elephants are old enough to find their own food and protect 
        themselves, they leave the herd and live on their own or form bachelor herds with other males. Only after they 
        become adults do they visit herds of females, and that is only for short periods of time to breed. Bulls do not 
        take part in caring for the young.
