        <h1>Zebra</h1>
        <p>
          Zebras (subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive
          black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: the
          Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi), plains zebra (E. quagga), and the
          mountain zebra (E. zebra). Zebras share the genus Equus with horses
          and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the
          family Equidae. Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to
          each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function
          of these stripes, with most evidence supporting them as a deterrent
          for biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa and can
          be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, grasslands,
          woodlands, shrublands, and mountainous areas.

        <h1>Ecology and behaviour</h1>
        <p>
          Zebras may travel or migrate to better watered areas. Plains zebras
          have been recorded travelling 500 km (310 mi) between Namibia and
          Botswana, the longest land migration of mammals in Africa. When
          migrating, they appear to rely on some memory of the locations where
          foraging conditions were best and may predict conditions months after
          their arrival.[78] Plains zebras are more water-dependent and live in
          more mesic environments than other species. They seldom wander 10–12
          km (6.2–7.5 mi) from a water source. Grévy's zebras can survive almost
          a week without water but will drink daily when it is plentiful and
          conserve water well. Mountain zebras can be found at elevations of up
          to 2,000 m (6,600 ft). Zebras may spend seven hours a day sleeping.
          During the day, they sleep standing up, while at night they lie down.
          They regularly rub against trees, rocks, and other objects and roll
          around in dust for protection against flies and irritation. Except for
          the mountain zebra, zebras can roll over completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zebras eat primarily grasses and sedges but may also consume bark,
          leaves, buds, fruits, and roots if their favoured foods are scarce.
          Compared to ruminants, zebras have a simpler and less efficient
          digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist on lower-quality
          vegetation. Zebras may spend 60–80% of their time feeding, depending
          on the availability and quality of vegetation. The plains zebra is a
          pioneer grazer, mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy
          and preparing the way for more specialised grazers, which depend on
          shorter and more nutritious grasses below.
        </p>
        pZebras are preyed on mainly by lions. Leopards, cheetahs, spotted
        hyenas, brown hyenas and wild dogs pose less of a threat to adults. Nile
        crocodiles also prey on zebras when they near water. Biting and kicking
        are a zebra's defense tactics. When threatened by lions, zebras flee,
        and when caught they are rarely effective in fighting off the big cats.
        In one study, the maximum speed of a zebra was found to be 13.8 m/s (50
        km/h; 31 mph) while a lion was measured at 20.6 m/s (74 km/h; 46 mph).
        Zebras do not escape lions by speed alone but by sideways turning,
        especially when the predator is close behind. With smaller predators
        like hyenas and dogs, zebras may act more aggressively, especially in
        defense of their young.
